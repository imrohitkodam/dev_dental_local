COM_TJLMS_ABOUT_LMS="Shika in Marathi means 'to learn'. Like with many ideas, this idea started out of frustration of the lack of good LMS systems for Joomla. Sure there are a few but we saw a dire need of something different with a fresh approach. Shika is a Learning Management System (LMS) for Joomla. Its been in development now for more than a year & is in production use at some of our clients. We are now beginning the process to generalize the development as a plug & play product for Joomla based eLearning."
